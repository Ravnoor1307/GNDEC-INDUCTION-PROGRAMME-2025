This repository contains my induction report for B.Tech 1st year(2025 2026)

DAY 1:

My journey at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College began on 1st August 2025, a day that I will always cherish as the foundation of my college life. All the IT and CSE students assembled at the Seminar Workshop Hall, where we were welcomed with a sense of enthusiasm and anticipation. The day commenced with an assessment test designed to evaluate our skills in Mathematics and English, setting an academic tone for what lies ahead.

After the two-hour test, we were guided to the college auditorium for an insightful seminar. The session was titled “Food – A Pivotal Role in a Student’s Overall Wellness”, delivered by Dr. Arshdeep Singh from Punjab Agricultural University. The seminar highlighted the profound impact of nutrition on our academic performance, mental health, and lifestyle. It was both informative and thought-provoking, leaving us more aware of how our dietary choices influence our productivity and well-being.

An interesting highlight of the day was the presentation by the NCC team, which included a brief introduction and a short documentary showcasing the team’s discipline, achievements, and opportunities available for students. It was inspiring to witness the spirit of service and commitment that the NCC team upheld.

What made the day even more special was the beautifully decorated campus, full of life and energy. From colorful banners to inspiring quotes, the entire environment was carefully curated to celebrate the arrival of the new batch. The kindness and hospitality shown by the staff and seniors added to the charm of the occasion.

Looking back, my first day at GNDEC was truly a memorable and enriching experience. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life—filled with hopes, aspirations, and positivity. I could clearly envision the next four years shaping me into a better version of myself, both personally and professionally.
