DAY 2:

My journey at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College began on 1st August 2025, a day that I will always cherish as the foundation of my college life. All the IT and CSE students assembled at the Seminar Workshop Hall, where we were welcomed with a sense of enthusiasm and anticipation. The day commenced with an assessment test designed to evaluate our skills in Mathematics and English, setting an academic tone for what lies ahead.
<br>

After the two-hour test, we were guided to the college auditorium for an insightful seminar. The session was titled “Food – A Pivotal Role in a Student’s Overall Wellness”, delivered by Dr. Arshdeep Singh from Punjab Agricultural University. The seminar highlighted the profound impact of nutrition on our academic performance, mental health, and lifestyle. It was both informative and thought-provoking, leaving us more aware of how our dietary choices influence our productivity and well-being.
<br>

What made the day even more special was the beautifully decorated campus, full of life and energy. From colorful banners to inspiring quotes, the entire environment was carefully curated to celebrate the arrival of the new batch. The kindness and hospitality shown by the staff and seniors added to the charm of the occasion.
<br>

Looking back, my first day at GNDEC was truly a memorable and enriching experience. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life—filled with hopes, aspirations, and positivity. I could clearly envision the next four years shaping me into a better version of myself, both personally and professionally.
<br>

DAY 3:
<br>

The second day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College was full of inspiration, learning, and self-reflection. It was one of the most interactive and exciting days so far, where we not only gained knowledge but also felt truly connected with our journey ahead.
<br>

We had a very interesting and fun-filled session with Dr. Jaswinder Singh, who is well known for his JaswinS Lab on Wheels. He made Physics and Mathematics come alive through simple and fun experiments and demonstrations. It was amazing to see how difficult concepts could be explained in such an easy and enjoyable way.
<br>

Later, we had the continuation of Universal Human Values – Part 1 by Dr. Priya Darshni. Her words once again helped us think deeply about our life goals, relationships, and the kind of person we want to become. She explained things in such a calm and clear manner that it truly left an impact on all of us.
<br>

We were also very lucky to have S. Gurcharan Singh Grewal, the Secretary of SGPC, as the Chief Guest. He shared some very motivational thoughts and encouraged us to stay focused, work hard, and make the most of our college years.
<br>

The day ended with interactive discussion sessions, where we reflected on our English and Maths test results from Day 1. It helped us understand where we stand and what areas we need to improve.
<br>

Overall, it was a wonderful day filled with learning, laughter, motivation, and self-discovery. Each session brought something meaningful, and I felt even more excited for the days to come
<br>

DAY 4:
<br>

The third day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College continued to offer a blend of academic learning, self-development, and student engagement. Each session brought with it something valuable, helping us feel more settled and excited about the journey ahead.
<br>

The day began with an English speaking lecture by Prof. Nisha. She started the class by giving a short introduction about herself and then asked each student to introduce themselves one by one. When it was my turn, I felt a little nervous and fumbled a bit, but it turned out to be a positive experience. The supportive atmosphere made it easier, and it helped me gain a bit more confidence in public speaking.
<br>

Our second lecture was Chemistry, conducted by Prof. Rajvir. She introduced herself and then led a wonderful discussion on the real-life applications of electrochemistry. It was interesting to connect classroom concepts with real-world situations. Towards the end of the class, she gave us heartfelt encouragement to make the most of our four years at GNDEC, which left a lasting impact on me.
<br>

The third session of the day was Universal Human Values – Part 2, held in the auditorium, and once again led by Dr. Priya Darshni. She continued from where she left off on the second day, diving deeper into self-awareness, emotional well-being, and how our thoughts and actions shape our future. Her lecture was calming, insightful, and made us reflect on who we are and who we want to become.
<br>

The final session was conducted by the Causmic Club. The members gave us a detailed overview of the club’s activities, achievements, and how students could be part of it. Their presentation was energetic and inspiring, showing us how GNDEC provides a platform not only for academics but also for leadership, creativity, and community building
